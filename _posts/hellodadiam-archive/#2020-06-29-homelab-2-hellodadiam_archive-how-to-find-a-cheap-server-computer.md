> This is the beginning of your journey: finding a dedicated computer to build all your dreams upon. We’ll talk about what you need, where to search, and some tips and tricks on getting the best value.


Ironically the first post will not be about anything software. After all, we have to find you a nice tower or some hardware to run everything on. You don’t have to spend a fortune, I only spent $50 on my server. It comes down to research, timing, and a bit of help from Lady Luck.

## Requirements

You may think that this computer needs to be decked out with the highest graphics card, unlocked and overclocked CPUs, a terabyte of RAM and a perbype of SSD storage. Well, you’re not wrong, kind of. If you are going for a rendering server, then yes you’ll need some good hardware so things run smoothly and stuff does not crash. But for the rest of us plebeians, 2000’s hardware will do. Take my computer for example. It’s a 1999 Dell Optiplex tower with 4GB of RAM and onboard GPU. There is nothing fancy you need unless you have something specific in mind. For you casuals, here is my list of base specs needed to run a home server:

Intel Celeron
2GB DDR2 RAM
1TB HDD Storage
A Power Supply that doesn’t explode.
A Motherboard that works
Soft-tube Water-cooling with RGB
Of course, that last one was a joke. Any kind of cooling is fine. You can just ditch the case and put your components in the fridge if you really wanted to.

As you can see, there’s no reason to kill your wallet over hardware. Honestly, you can probably find all of this for free on local classified advertisement sites or second hand PC parts shops or even just asking your friends & family. Speaking of which, let’s take a look at where you can search for all these parts.

## What & Where to Look

Besides those close to you, the internet is the second best place to find things. You can use your advertisement sites to put out your requests in hopes of someone finding your plea. Sites like eBay and maybe even Amazon are your best bet if you can get lucky. You’ll want to have your filter by Price: Lowest to Highest.

Then it is just about patience and practice. You’ll most likely find the winning listing from an auction on eBay. Here is a link to an article by eBay on [Tips to Win an Auction](https://www.ebay.com/help/buying/bidding/tips-winning-auctions?id=4015). We recommend you reading it to give yourself the best chance of winning. We suggest you try for the holiday season where discounts are good. But with sites like eBay, there is never a set rule. People’s lives are chaotic and anything can happen. Spending 5 minutes once a week searching would be reasonable. There are also outlet seller son eBay that have cheap old computers from companies that have gone bankrupt. These are probity the best values you will get. usually, this happens near the beginning and middle of the year. All in all, just going about your life and having this search in the back of your mind is the easiest and possible the best way to go about it if you aren’t in a hurry. You might not get all your parts in one go. Maybe a CPU here and a case there. Be patience as this will probably the last time you’ll not be occupied with anything for your server. Take your time, be patient, and the greats will come to you. Of course, with all that being said, the tower is not the only things you’ll need.

## Extra’s You’ll Need

Some extra include a ethernet cable to a switch or your router or modem as you are not gonna be using Wifi for your HIGHSPEED™ server. Here is a short list of other stuff you may need to look for or DIY.

Ethernet Cable
Power Extension Cord
Good Router/Modem
Good Internet Speeds
Extra Mouse/Keyboard
Monitor (You can also go headless but you’ll need one for the initial setup)

## Conclusion

And that’s it! With a bit of luck, skill, and blessing from the cosmos, you will have gotten your very own second-hand computer for less than $100 bucks! If you didn’t, don’t worry. Your parts are sure to be cheaper than brand new together. Regardless, make sure you think over of what is important for you in what this server will do. I suggest you make a list or use [Newegg’s PC Builder](https://www.newegg.com/tools/custom-pc-builder) to make sure you have all your parts. No matter how long you take, we’ll be here patiently waiting for your return. Once you’re done, congratulations! Welcome to the beginning of your end. We will see all of you in the next post…maybe…
