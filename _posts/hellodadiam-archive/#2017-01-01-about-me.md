Hi, I'm the guy who runs this site for now because this is my site. You can't have it. Anyways, I'm just here to be part of the internet archive; don't mind me.

I’m just your average freelance coder who is bored and made this blog page as a project to learn web development. Of course I did cheat and use WordPress but believe me when I say I do have “some” custom JS code running somewhere that is essential to running this site. Of course, I can’t find it anymore. No big deal. I’m sure it’ll turn up sooner or later. Anyways, browse around and let me know your feedback or what you’d like to see me post about next. Don’t be afraid to contact me either if you have anything you want to talk about. Remember to always have fun!

ps. If you find any spelling or grammar or weird word issues, that’s just me being lazy and not learning how to spell past 5th grade. I’m not getting paid enough for this after all.
