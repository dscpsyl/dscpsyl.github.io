I like furiously typing at a coffee shop on the weekend with sunglasses as much as the next guy. But when I actually start coding, I find myself trying the same lines over and over again. Why would I waste precious time rethinking and retyping logic that I know already works. Sometimes, I forget how and I end up with a less perfect version of a previous code snippet. Besides, with my 20 wpm typing speed, I’d say each and every character counts.

## Reuse Reduce Recycle

Enter code snippets. A primitive, yet indispensable way of a programmer’s life. Some may call it cheating. I call it using the resources available to you.

Why would you write a wrapper function over and over again in your code when there is a shorthand for it? The same applies here. After building up your code snippet library for even just half a year, you can speed up your programming time immensely. Not to mention reserving your brain power for the immediate task at hand and not trying to remember how to implement that one obscure method.

These snippets don’t even have to be one or two lines. Sometimes, they are whole files or even programs. Yet they are still snippets because they are useless without the programmer modifying them or adding onto them for their specific use case.

## Paywall? Nah

Of course, people realize this and they have already capitalized on such a useful idea. Code snippet libraries and collection software are everywhere, promising an organized and efficient code snippet storage. However, they are all doing the same thing, with a few skin changes: writing a text file with a title and maybe some tags into different folders. Huh, that sounds like any old notes taking software. And, lo and behold, it is literally just a notes taking software. Your operating system most likely already came with that! Just store your Coe snippets there. That app likely also has an API to interact with it so you can automate your side stage too! Paywalls are never an excuse for programmers cause you can make the exact same thing. It’s literally your job to do so.

## Conclusion

It might seem tedious at first to try and record every little snippet you think could be useful, especially if you have been coding for quite some time. However, as a programmer, I’m sure you can find a way to automate it. You might even find a code snippet for that too! This was a short rant but there seems to be some kind of taboo for using code snippets. You are only limiting yourself from your true potential. So save yourself some trouble, and help the world progress with code snippets.
