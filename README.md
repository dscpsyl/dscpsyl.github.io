# Notes to Myself

## You will Forget
You will forget how this site works after a few days so here is something for future me to take a look at. You are using the [`Hydejack`](hydejack.com) theme for [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/), pro version. The documentation for this theme is located in the `docs` folder of the repo. While not listed directly on the webpage, you can still access this via `/docs` on the website directly.

## How to Add a Page
Take a look at the basics [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

TLDR: Just add a new `page.md` to the root of this repo for a page with some front matter. An example front matter is shown below:

```markdown
---
title: Documentation
description: >
  Here you should be able to find everything you need to know to accomplish the most common tasks when blogging with Hydejack.
hide_description: true
sitemap: false
permalink: /docs/
---
```

Or, if you have a bunch of items for one page, you can add a folder to the root of the repo and add an `index.md` file to that folder. This will make all the pages have the folder name permalink.

In addition, if you want, you can set the `permalink` frontmatter (as shown in the example) to fully control the URL.
